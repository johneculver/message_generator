# Message Generator

## Project Description
### Output
This project generates a random phrase that contains 3 elements:
1. A composer's name
2. An action
3. A place or thing where the action is performed

### Purpose
The project originated as a Codecademy portfolio project named "Message Generator," which is designed to demonstrate the learner's understanding of JavaScript and Git. I chose historical musical figures with a twist of (debatable) humor because I have a background in classical music.

### Development
The project began by feeding arrays with the strings that could be randomly selected for each part of the sentence. Each string is selected by one of three Math.random and Math.floor operations embedded in a function that ultimately concatenates the 3 chosen sentence parts. This file was then added to and committed to a local Git repository, and later uploaded to a Github project folder.

After completing this required segment of the project, I wanted to create a simple UI that would allow friends and colleagues to access the project if it was of interest. I built the following items:
1. An HTML page with a button that would trigger the function
2. A CSS stylesheet
3. A copied normalization spreasheet from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

### Challenges
I also changed the JS file to get document elements and enable event listeners for click of the button. This part was challenging, as I have not covered this functionality yet in Codecademy. w3schools, MDN, and StackExchange were extremely helpful resources in overcoming these challenges.

## Installation guide
